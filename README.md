# V.I.S.O.R. - Utils
Utilities package of V.I.S.O.R.

This repository is a submodule on the [V.I.S.O.R. - Server Version Assistant](https://github.com/Edw590/VISOR---Server-Version-Assistant) project (the main project).

## What it does
These utilities are used on the entire V.I.S.O.R. Server Version project. All functions here are supposed to (and do) work on all main operating systems (Unix-like and Windows) - they are universal.

They can't also be *completely* used as a standalone package since some of the functions here use V.I.S.O.R. modules - various don't though. The Email utilities do use the Email Sender module, for example. I wanted them to be completely independent from the modules, but at least the way I tried, it created cyclic imports and Go doesn't allow that. So all utilities and exported functions are here and the modules have only private elements and use these exported ones only.
